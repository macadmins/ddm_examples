## Assets
# Assets go here. They should be applied before anything else.
# Examples:
# io.macadmins.asset.zsh

## Configs
# Configurations go here. They should be specified before the activiation references them
# Examples:
# io.macadmins.config.swu
# io.macadmins.config.zsh

## Activations
# Examples:
# Add activations here. A config will not be applied unless there is an activation for it. Create this last
# io.macadmins.activation.swu
# io.macadmins.activation.zsh

## Management
# Management items go here. They seem to be standalone-ish and work without an explicit activation
# Examples:
# io.macadmins.management.props
