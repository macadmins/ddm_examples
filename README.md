# ddm_examples
Examples of DDM on macOS for use with kmfddm

This repo contains a set of DDM declarations, including Configurations, Assets and Activations. 

Along with a [nanoMDM](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm) server, a [kmfddm](https://github.com/jessepeterson/kmfddm) server and [syncdir](https://github.com/jessepeterson/kmfddm/blob/main/tools/syncdir.py), one can test a good chunk of the new DDM server functionality that is landing in macOS 14.0, including Managed Software Updates.

For more information about which declarations are supported on macOS 14.0, see Apple's [official repo for Device Management](https://github.com/apple/device-management/tree/seed_iOS-17-0_macOS-14-0/declarative)
